            <P>
                Discrete Mathematics deals with the study of Mathematical structures. It deals with objects that can have distinct separate values. It is also called Decision Mathematics or finite Mathematics . It is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete in nature and it does not require the notion of continuity.
